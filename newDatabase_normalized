#victorylab Q15 from @JBumstead87 Have any studies on the effectiveness / cost benefit of live vs robo callers? Does effect differ by age? 
#victorylab @JonathanGormley has a followup about word of mouth: Hard to create treatments for that though, no? 
#victorylab Q14 from @Geoff_Sharpe: Is there any data that compares the efficacy of different types of ads (online, tv, radio, etc)? 
#victorylab Q13 from @katieharbath: many operatives don't know how or see value in testing. Do you see that changing? 
#victorylab Q12 from me -- When people learn about what you write in book, they say "that's so scary." But did you just scratch surface? 
#victorylab Q11 from @JBumstead87 Have campaigns been able to integrate GIS & other such techniques to aid in microtargetting efforts? 
#victorylab Q10 from @JonathanGormley What's next aspect of campaigns that needs testing? What tactic hasn't been sufficiently measured yet? 
#victorylab Q9 from @geoff_sharpe You brought up RePurpose in recent blogpost. Are there studies/data on gamification's affect on campaigns? 
#victorylab Q8 from @gronke: Charles Merriam pioneered field experiments in the 1920s. Why take so long for polsci to return? 
#victorylab Q7 from @wantnews Who are these voters that don't vote? 
#victorylab Q6 from @katieharbath Do you see down-ticket senate & congressional races using the same tactics you write about in the book? 
#victorylab Q5 from @noahchestnut: Should campaign spokespeople have to work in media (writer/editor/sales)? 
#victorylab Q4 also from @Geoff_Sharpe on tactics that smaller campaigns can easily integrate into their election? 
#victorylab Q3 from @Geoff_Sharpe: Is there applicability of science-based testing for smaller, less well-funded campaigns? 
#victorylab Q2 from @alex_patton - wants to know about failed behavorial experiments.

Also expect lots of family talk -- remember still introducing Romney to nation, looking to boost popularity/familiarity #allaccess 
The campaign has kept that close so far but likely big focus on economy & his role as manager/biz man/turnaround artist. #allaccess 
Yes, the strip clubs likely to be busy in both Tampa and Charlotte. Lots of reporting on Sarah Palin lookalikes hired in Tampa. #allaccess 
Republicans did address DC's situation/guns in platform. Good story here: http://t.co/YXzOkaqY #allaccess

@MattBushMD O'Malley really seems to be positioning self, testing msg as fmr Mayor & proud liberal for 2016 Dem primary. #dividedbydc 
@MattBushMD McD surely will be on "shortlist" for Romney but Va has long gotten up hopes in veepstakes, saw them crushed. #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live Women's issues resonating ev.where. McDonnell saw overreach/backed off. legislature long had focused on abortion #dividedbydc 
@MattBushMD Thanks for insight. We should talk for this project as we continue covering the debate. #dividedbydc 
@_Chesapeake The Confederacy still runs deep in Va, tons of monuments, anniversaries, etc. But things are changing, too. #dividedbydc 
@JesseFFerguson It shows how Va growing. So many new residents not everyone remembers Allen as gov in 90s. But CLOSE race #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live Environment 1 thing O'Malley/McDonnell agree on. Both fight for clean Chesapeake. But gas tax? No agreement. #dividedbydc 
@MattBushMD Question fr YOU -- will MD Dems ultimately go along w/ tax increase there? How will budget standoff shake out? #dividedbydc 
@MattBushMD Just look at how Va's T.V. ultrasound issue made natl comedy shows, mocked state legislators. #dividedbydc 
@MattBushMD You wouldn't think so, but ask Scott Walker that Q. These things can snowball, take on natl significance. #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live Also McDonnell & O'Malley obviously have national ambition so this yr is test case for each in future runs. #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live Natl parties each arguing their vision better, Va/Md represent laboratories for each, same challenges everywhere #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live Both govs have legislature of same party. But one says spend for the future, other says spending too much. #dividedbydc 
@brucelesley That's big Q. Md has higher taxes for svcs, but as we've been writing they struggle to agree on budget funding it #dividedbydc 
@NewsHour_Live I'm Va. politics nerd, covered state & @kpolantz came fr. @RoanokeTimes. Plus McD & O'M interesting cats. #dividedbydc

Starting in 2014, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition that causes higher rates. #obamacare 
So, I am looking forward to the full implementation of #obamacare so I do not have to fight with my health provider on an ongoing basis. 
We are living at the end of that era until Jan. 1. And folks like me under 65 will have to endure this until #obamacare fully kicks in. 
Starting in 2014, insurers will no longer be able to raise rates as they can right now. #obamacare 
It's hard to respond to Rush the entertainer while working, but I am sure he needs a primer on #obamacare. Ok, I own a small business. 
Why are your health insurance premiums higher? Price gauging, not #Obamacare. My provider told me it was because of my age. More to come.

One of the top candidates in our bang-for-the-buck metric is ... Todd Akin. #politicallyincorrectmath 
To wit, there have only been $170,000 in independent expenditures in #MASEN. Why? Warren and Brown have all the money they need. 
My book is outselling "Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches" http://t.co/5n7XHeGo #winning 
Also, it's remarkable how unassertive GOP has been on foreign policy & social policy. Economy is #1 issue but not literally the only one. 
We'll have Thompson (R) up about 4 in #WISEN. He's ahead in polls and is probably the better candidate, although his fundraising stinks. 
In #CTSEN, model has Murphy (D) up ~4. Recent polls are almost tied but the fundamentals ought to favor him. 
In #NVSEN, model has Heller (R) ahead but only by 1-2 points. Surprises me a bit. But Berkley's raised more money & NV becoming blue-leaning 
In #MTSEN, the model has Tester down about 4. Rehberg's a very tough challenger and a good match for MT's center-right politics. 
In #MASEN, the model's showing almost exact tie. Brown's a hair ahead in polls. But so hard for GOPer to win there in a presidential year.

Romney has succeeded brilliantly at making Perry so mad that he's less articulate than before! #CNNdebate

'A tough couple of debates for Rick.. You're going to get testy.' Mitt, you THINK this but don't say it. #CNNdebate

I wonder if Romney paid everyone else to spend this whole debate ganging up on Cain #CNNdebate 
What Newt is trying to say about Herman Cain is 'credit to his race' #CNNdebate

It is kind of sad watching Herman Cain try to defend this with "apples and oranges" as his only riff #CNNdebate 
Romney, who has not spoken, again the big winner of first 15 minutes of fratricide among the rest #CNNdebate 
'The state tax is an apple. We are replacing it with oranges.' To repeat: Cain is appealing but not great debater on details #CNNdebate 
Serious question: how are these debates, as they roll on, any different from Survivor or Biggest Loser? #CNNdebate 
Cain is a very appealing character IMHO but not at his best in defending details of his plan #CNNdebate 
Santorum with rational point! 999 plan would raise taxes for 84% of people. Class warfare!!! #Cnndebate

Boehner: Amazingly strong stand against Chinese currency bill #IdeasForum 
Boehner: 'We've got a big deficit problem, a big debt problem...' Sentences does not include 'big jobs problem.' #IdeasForum

Juror B37: Shocked by media coverage at trial, "looked like Disney World." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I didn't see it as a racial thing. I saw it as a second-degree murder case." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "It was hard thinking someone lost their life and nothing else could be done about it." (Nothing could be done?!) #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "It was emotional to a point...After we put our vote in that's when everybody started to cry." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I think both of them could have walked away." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I have no doubt George feared for his life in the situation he was in at the time." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37 cites Stand Your Ground law for Zimmerman's benefit: "He had a right to defend himself." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "There was a couple of jurors in there who wanted to find him guilty of something." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Jury instructions were "just so confusing what went with what." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: The person who felt second-degree was convinced it was not second-degree, moved to manslaughter. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "The law became very confusing." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "Nobody's going to know what exactly happened except for George." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: State should have done a better job preserving evidence. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Was one of the 3 jurors who originally felt Zimmerman was not guilty. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Spent the first day getting organized, nominated foreman, organized evidence. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Not worried that #Zimmerman gets his gun back. "I think he would be more responsible than anybody else on the planet right now." 
Juror B37: "I think he just didn't know when to stop. He was frustrated and things just got out of hand." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37 says Zimmerman didn't stop at the limitations he should have stopped at. (Then how is he innocent?) #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Didn't believe Zimmerman ws a wannabe cop. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: George Zimmerman "over eager to help people." (Yes, she actually said that.) #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Zimmerman "just profiled anybody who came into the neighborhood acting strange." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Doesn't think any of the jurors felt race played any role in the case. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Anybody would think anybody walking down road walking, turning, and looking is suspicious. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: I think George would have reacted in the exact same way if Trayvon had not been black. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: I don't think George racially profiled Trayvon Martin, there were "unbelievable number of robberies." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: If I was a mother I would want to believe it was not my son so I would convince myself. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Both George Zimmerman's and Trayvon Martin's parents said what any parents would say. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "George had a right to protect himself." Thinks Trayvon Martin threw the first punch. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Can't say for sure whether Trayvon Martin reached for the gun, but it doesn't make a difference. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I'm sure there were some fabrications" but pretty much happened the way George said. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I think George is pretty consistent and told the truth basically." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "It's everybody's right to carry a gun." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "George Zimmerman is "guilty of not using good judgment," "shouldn't have gotten out of the car." #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place...got displaced by vandalism in neighborhood." #ZimmermanTrial 
This is important! After listening to all the evidence, 3 of the jurors in the #ZimmermanTrial originally felt George Zimmerman was guilty. 
Defense Attorney Mark O'Mara said prosecutors "denigrate" the jury's decision. "How dare they" question jury's verdict. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37 doesn't seems to be confused about key elements of the case she just spent 3 weeks following. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Didn't find Rachel Jeantel credible as a witness but did believe her "creepy ass cracker" statement. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: Rachel Jeantel wasn't a good witness, used phrases I had never heard before. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: I didn't think Rachel Jeantel's testimony was very credible. #ZimmermanTrial 
Juror B37: "I think it was George Zimmerman's" voice on the 911 call. All but probably 1 of jurors agreed. #ZimmermanTrial 
I think Juror B37 says Dr. Vincent Di Maio was most credible, "awe-inspiring." She can't remember his name. #ZimmermanTrial

John Guy: "This case is not about race. It's about right and wrong." #ZimmermanTrial 
And we're back. John Guy resumes. #ZimmermanTrial 
Mark O'Mara interrrupts John Guy's closing argument. #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: A reasonable doubt needs to be reasonable and it needs to go to an element of the crime. #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: Why didn't Trayvon Martin go home? Use your common sense. Did he really want to lead Zimmerman to his house? #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: "Ask yourself who lost the fight," puts up picture, Sybrina Fulton looks away. #ZimmermanTrial http://t.co/JEzFKgUFH7 
George Zimmerman is not looking at John Guy during the closing argument. #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: What is it when a grown man gets out of his car and shoots an unarmed child? Is that nothing? #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: "Your verdict is not going to change the past. But it will forever define it." #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: I'm not asking you to fill gaps. I'm asking you to start from the beginning. #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: If you don't like Rachel Jeantel or Dr. Shiping Bao, ask yourself who produced this trial. #ZimmermanTrial 
John Guy: There are no Rachel Jeantels on CSI. #ZimmermanTrial 
So Zimmerman's injuries are evidence of ill will and spite but Trayvon Martin's dead body is not? #ZimmermanTrial 
Mark O'Mara keeps going back to Dennis Root. In my mind, he was one of the least credible witnesses in the case, with the uncle being #1.

Try lying on your back and pulling out something from your back pocket. Now imagine you're "fat" and "weak" and do it. #zimmermantrial 
Dennis Root: "Always a good idea to identify yourself" in that type of situation. #zimmermantrial 
The prosecution is destroying this guy, Dennis Root. #zimmermantrial 
Dennis Root just started his consulting company, Dennis Root & Associates, in 2013, just in time for the #zimmermantrial. 
If #Zimmerman was so "fat" and physically weak, why did he get out of his car and follow someone he thought was armed and suspicious? 
Dennis Root has now been testifying for an hour and I see no value to it whatsoever. #zimmermantrial 
Dennis Root has been on the witness stand for 45 minutes now and hasn't offered any statement about the actual #Zimmerman case yet. 
The #zimmermantrial resumes. Judge will not allow animation video as substantive evidence, may be used as demonstrative for witness only. 
But it's so cute...when the NRA does it. #zimmermantrial http://t.co/284hPDVe49

There's some discussion going on about broccoli that I guess is supposed to be more important than the #zimmermantrial. 
Once again, I find this whole inquiry misguided. The point is not who was yelling or who was on top, but who started it. #zimmermantrial 
Nothing against Eloise Dilligard, but her testimony is useless. Nothing new or relevant here. #zimmermantrial 
Dr. Di Maio reviewed photos and written reports in #zimmermantrial but did not view Trayvon Martin's body, as medical examiner Dr. Bao did. 
After 2 long hours discussing the defense team's animation, Judge Debra Nelson calls for the #zimmermantrial to resume. No video for now. 
I don't think these types of animation videos should be allowed in the #zimmermantrial or any court unless both sides create it together. 
Is the defense in the #zimmermantrial really planning to argue that marijuana makes you violent? Does anyone seriously believe that? 
Was George Zimmerman "grossly obese" on the night he killed Trayvon Martin? #zimmermantrial http://t.co/cp7Qj3kPWI

Rand Paul finally ends his #filibuster at 12:39 a.m. 
Maybe someone will #filibuster until Congress passes a Jobs Bill. That's what the American people need most right now. 
I agree with what Tim Scott is saying but he would never have said this if GW Bush were President. That's the hypocrisy of the #filibuster. 
@BuzzFeedAndrew @RyanLizza I disagree. You can oppose the drone policy, as I do, without supporting a meaningless #filibuster. 
Congress should just do its job and pass a law setting the parameters of U.S. drone policy. You don't need a #filibuster to do that. 
But this #filibuster seems pointless to me. 
And if everybody agrees that Brennan is going to be confirmed anyway, whats the point of the #filibuster again? 
Are Republicans supporting the #filibuster because they agree with critique of the drone policy or because they want to stick it to Obama? 
I'm confused about this #filibuster. I don't support the administration's drone policy re: U.S. citizens but I thought most Republicans did.

Too bad WaPo no longer has an ombudsman to whom we could complain about #bannedphrases. 
Interesting that so few of WaPo's lingering cliches about Watergate get the book (twisting slowly in the wind, et al). #bannedphrases 
I guess "-gate" is banned since it infringes on WaPo's Watergate copyright. #bannedphrases

My guess is that the FISC order is a standard de facto immunity waiver _gifted_ to every bulk #NSA data provider every 3 months 
Oversight ain‚Äôt the solution to #NSA bulk data collection. Congress knows the program intimately. Obviously the judicial branch does too. 
So all my Verizon iPhone calls to 301-688-XXXX -- those were to you, #NSA. Just saving you some time. 
I won't say #NSA is SPYING on millions of Americans. But grabbing their phone records? Very fair to say now until shown otherwise. 
So what rules does the gov't abide by for #NSA surveillance? @dbgrady & I have educated reported guesses in our book. http://t.co/zfYCQqar22 
And document seems absolutely legitimate. I read it to intel official who said "Uh, can't talk about that." #NSA 
Barrier between NSA/FBI(DOJ) seems to be completely dissolved. FBI applied for data; it was given to #NSA here. http://t.co/7ZDWYKurpz

Amazing answer about what didn't work w/ ads: "almost everything we did, failed... then we made it better." Point: test, test, test. #gpis 
Good ads advice: use engagement metrics to inform content. #gpis 
Q: anything out of campaigns that could be productized for broader application? A: challenge that political tech is purpose built. #gpis 
Q: Most important future tool. A: Look at mobile video. #gpis (something like Vine?) 
Amazing how much structure & culture make or break outcome. I think politics & govt needs to spend more time studying org psych & HR. #gpis 
Key theme: adapt your mode of outreach to the circumstance -- by locality, community i.e. SMS to some, Twitter for others. #gpis 
"The campaign that figures out having conversations (at scale) will be successful." #gpis (Good pt & Twitter is an ongoing conversation...) 
Campaigns are like a startup but diff in many ways: 1) ppl work harder (for less $), 2) govt gives a lot of useful info. #gpis 
Analyze the data, then do a check to make sure it has face validity - Romney camp. #gpis

Careers of Anne Hathaway & James Franco will not suffer b/c of poor Oscar hosting. Less accountability in Hollywood than politics. #oscars

Political polarization wasn't caused by Obama and won't be solved by him or Romney in next year with a meeting. #debates. 
These candidates have huge differences on education. Obama for far more dollars, Romney strong backer of school vouchers. #debates 
Candidates Obama and H. Clinton had detailed plans on many issues. Romney can write a plan now and still allow Congress input later.#debates 
Best point from Obama yet. Romney is saying smart things now, but his policy plans are incomplete on taxes and healthcare. #debates 
Yes, true. "Obamacare" and 2006 Massachusetts health care law are in many ways identical. Mandates, subsidies, etc. #debates 
Glad Obama pointed out that people who are in their 50's may care about Medicare changes proposed by Romney. #debates 
The "winners and losers line" was definitely one of the planned Romney zingers. #debates. 
A clear, meaningful point here: Romney would not raise taxes as president for deficit reduction. Ever. #debates. 
Okay, so in reality, neither candidate supports entire Bowles-Simpson plan. I hope Lehrer presses on which parts they like. #debates 
Still not sure I've heard a lot of ideas to create jobs. Education is a long-term, not short-term solution. #debates 
Romney still has not spelled out which deductions he wants to get rid in order to make sure his tax plan does not increase deficit #debates

I love the honesty of @DottieandBogey Pepper. The Euros chipped & putted better than us. Golf is about the short game! #SolheimCup 
1st time in #SolheimCup history, Europe wins it on U.S. soil. 1st time they've ever gone back-to-back. Hedwall 1st in history to go 5-0. WOW 
Wow. Hedwall just STUFFED her approach shot on 18. Wie couldn't answer. She gotta make a helluva putt to save Team USA. #SolheimCup 
Storms have stopped played at the #SolheimCup. Guess I can get this 30-minute exercise bike routine in! LOL #hiprehab 
@ErickaLassiter loving this! #SolheimCup 
American veterans absolutely let Team USA down. Lewis and Creamer failed to win full point when they needed to come up big. #SolheimCup 
Pressure bust pipes! Stacy Lewis hits an awful approach shot on 18. She could lose this match. Will be turble for USA. #SolheimCup

‚Äú@JamesAhern91: I wouldn't give anyone a gimme! #SolheimCup‚Äù me too! Gotta earn it, baby!

Stacy Lewis blowing chance after chance to take control of her match. Team USA needs her to step it up. We need that point! #SolheimCup 
Team USA battling hard to keep Europe from winning its first #SolheimCup on American soil. Come on, USA. Let's do this! 
‚Äú@jhave: Congrats to the Solheim Cup winners from Europe! Well done! Convincing victory!!! #SolheimCup‚Äù slow down, son. This ain't over yet! 
Can someone please go give Paula @thepcreamer a hug? She's getting destroyed by this 17-year-old in the #SolheimCup. This is brutal! 
American rookies are golfin their ball! Playing superb golf. Veterans Creamer and Lewis are letting the USA down. #SolheimCup

Y'all want to learn about a real life #Django Unchained? Go study Henri Christophe and Toussaint Louverture, leaders of Haitian Revolution! 
It's also important to note that #LeeDanielsTheButler also makes clear the work ethic of Black folks, even when confronted with daily racism 
RT @ForestWhitaker: #LeeDanielsthebutler, the living history of our Civil Rights movement thru the eyes of Cecil Gaines! Opens 16 August! h‚Ä¶ 
At the #LeeDanielsTheButler Q&A, moderator @RussParrShow said: "This is the kind of film Hollywood walks away from." 
In #LeeDanielsTheButler, he confronts the duality of Black life: putting on one face for white America; living with another face for us. 
Lee Daniels on The Freedom Riders: "Those kids on that bus were heroes." #LeeDanielsTheButler 
What I appreciate about #LeeDanielsTheButler is he didn't sugarcoat the timidity of Truman, Kennedy, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan in dealing w/Blacks 
Daniels said many of the actors took far less $$$ for #LeeDanielsTheButler than they normally would. He said they believed in the project. 
#LeeDanielsTheButler Cuba Gooding Jr. @LennyKravitz Clarence Williams III Terrence Howard @iJesseWilliams @minkakelly Alan Rickman 
Among the big names in #LeeDanielsTheButler: Robin Williams, Jane Fonda, Liev Schreiber, Vanessa Redgrave, John Cusack @Oprah 
#LeeDanielsTheButler is based off of a Washington Post story done by national correspondent Will Haygood. 
#LeeDanielsTheButler is loosely based on the life of White House butler Eugene Allen, who served 8 U.S. presidents over 34 years. 
He said various investors raised money to help finance the $25M film. "they were determined to prove the studio wrong" #LeeDanielsTheButler 
"You still have to keep proving yourself." Lee Daniels on dealing with Hollywood studios and making films that matter. #LeeDanielsTheButler 
Daniels found it perplexing that Precious was made for $10 million; earned $67 million; & the studio still tripped. #LeeDanielsTheButler 
I do believe 100% that #LeeDanielsTheButler is better than The Help. This movie is told through the lens of the Black lead character. 
@mrdaveyd There are very emotional moments in the film. #LeeDanielsTheButler. 
.@PoliticalSphinx #LeeDanielsTheButler is not a mopey, whiney movie. 
#LeeDanielsTheButler hits the theatre Aug. 16. DO NOT BE LATE. Seriously. You MUST see the opening scene. DO. NOT. BE. LATE. 
And @ForestWhitaker was amazing. The Oscar winner should receive another nod for #LeeDanielsTheButler. 
The script, cinematography in #LeeDanielsTheButler is so on-point. @Oprah killed it as @ForestWhitaker's wife. Seriously. 
Lee said, "How can you say that?" His son replied, "I want to see a Black Superman." Lee? "Good point." #LeeDanielsTheButler 
During the Q&A, Daniels made a great point about generations. He said a lot has changed. His son, 17, said not so much. #LeeDanielsTheButler 
#LeeDanielsTheButler should also challenge Black folks who look down on our ancestors who filled such jobs. We can't ignore our reality. 
If you have bought into the notion that the film is about subservient Black folks, think again. #LeeDanielsTheButler really hits home. 
The making of #LeeDanielsTheButler was difficult. Hollywood studios didn't want to approve a real budget to make the film. 
Saw #LeeDanielsTheButler tonight in DC. AWESOME movie. It really delves in the Civil Rights Movement & the world in which the butler worked. 
.@Keiras_lip_balm @seanhannity So I'm wrong? Why discuss @Oprah & #TrayvonMartin and book two people who agree with you? That's weak. 
This is when you know @SeanHannity is a straight up punk. He goes out & books two fools to trash @Oprah about her #TrayvonMartin comments.

Ron Paul and Santorum now stronger than Gingrich against Obama in the nation's 12 top swing states: http://t.co/YWtpZVAm #usatodaygallup 
The battle with Gingrich has made Romney a sharper debater and better candidate. #CNNdebate

Why does the #cnndebate act like we haven't met these guys before? #letsgettoaquestion 
Romney calls Obama "detached from reality" in a critique of the #SOTU in Orlando. Who he doesn't mention: Gingrich.

Zimmerman friend on the stand now. #zimmermantrial

Source tells me O'Mara previously objected to pastors sitting behind Martin parents. Said they should "alternate sides." #zimmermantrial 
Mark O'Mara now arguing that Trayvon Martin's parents should not be allowed to remain in the courtroom during arguments. #zimmermantrial 
Up to now, the defense has said Zimmerman was NOT following Trayvon Martin. Change of strategy, perhaps. #zimmermantrial 
Mistake by Don West? Said Trayvon Martin "Left or went back or hid, to see about this guy who was following him." #zimmermantrial 
Don West (defense) now saying "instead of going home," Trayvon Martin "chose to confront George Zimmerman. #zimmermantrial 
@jamngrammi The Don West "knock knock" joke strikes me as tonally, ill-advised. #zimmermantrial 
Zimmerman then says to "have them call me," meaning the police should not plan to meet him near the mailboxes. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor: "witnesses will tell you they heard a longer verbal exchange" between Zimmerman and Martin. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor: shot was a "contact shot. He pressed that gun into Trayvon Martin's chest." #zimmermantrial 
First I've heard that Zimmerman's gun was in "ready to fire" mode, with a round in the chamber. #zimmermantrial 
Zimmerman claimed Martin went for his gun. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor says DNA expert examined swabs from Zimmerman's gun holster, and no Martin DNA on the gun or holster. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor: DNA evidence will refute Zimmerman's statements. #zimmermnatrial 
Zimmerman stoic throughout the presentation. No change of expression through some pretty tough stuff. #zimmeermantril 
Trayvon Martin's parents now weeping in the courtroom. #zimmermantrial 
First time prosecutors have specified that Trayvon Martin was found "face down, his hands clutching his chest." #zimmermantrail 
This prosecutor came to play hardball. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor said Zimmerman's Kel-Tec semiautomatic pistol was in a "ready to fire" position, tucked into his waistband. #zimmermantrial 
Prosecutor says Zimmerman "thought it was his right to rid his neighborhood of anybody that he believed didn't belong." #zimmermantrial

30 min Break over. Onto my 6th hour of studying today. Who's gonna sponsor my vacay in August? #barexam 
Yeah I'm sure and ur question is just perpetuating #rapeculture btw. @MileHighBecky 
Responsible partying isn't rape prevention. Fact. #rapeculture 
Just don't tweet at me "we should teach girls about risks of partying" like just do not. #rapeculture like rape isn't caused by being drunk 
#rapeculture RT @harryallen: Is rape legitimate if she dresses sexy? One author argues yes http://t.co/3AhtCjVKoM 
@RichelleCarey yeah and I complety agree. It's something and hopefully she's willing to learn more about it. #babysteps

RT @NuclearWynter: @ZerlinaMaxwell the perfect example of #internalizedsexism the only people "asking for it" are women who are raped. 
Bc #rapeculture RT @MarieSurles: No I don't feel this way about all crimes. Rape is just different for me, it's hard to just blame one party 
Perhaps it's how you were raised. We all live in #rapeculture and are conditioned to blame women. #internalizedsexism @MarieSurles 
The questions we should all be asking include "why did they rape her?" "why didn't they call her a cab if she was so drunk?" #bystanderinter 
For now, I'm going to be polite b/c like I said I'm a fan of Serena's and women internalize this wrong messaging just like men. #rapeculture
