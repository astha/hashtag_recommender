JamesFallows	r	    Perry has reverted to his previous-debate standard on this Reagan Q. (And C Rose shifts follow up to Romney) #Econdebate Oct 12, 2011

keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: State should have done a better job preserving evidence. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Was one of the 3 jurors who originally felt Zimmerman was not guilty. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Spent the first day getting organized, nominated foreman, organized evidence. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Not worried that #Zimmerman gets his gun back. "I think he would be more responsible than anybody else on the planet right now." Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: "I think he just didn't know when to stop. He was frustrated and things just got out of hand." #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37 says Zimmerman didn't stop at the limitations he should have stopped at. (Then how is he innocent?) #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Didn't believe Zimmerman ws a wannabe cop. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013

keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Anybody would think anybody walking down road walking, turning, and looking is suspicious. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: I think George would have reacted in the exact same way if Trayvon had not been black. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: I don't think George racially profiled Trayvon Martin, there were "unbelievable number of robberies." #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: If I was a mother I would want to believe it was not my son so I would convince myself. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Both George Zimmerman's and Trayvon Martin's parents said what any parents would say. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: "George had a right to protect himself." Thinks Trayvon Martin threw the first punch. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Can't say for sure whether Trayvon Martin reached for the gun, but it doesn't make a difference. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: "I'm sure there were some fabrications" but pretty much happened the way George said. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013

keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: "George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place...got displaced by vandalism in neighborhood." #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    This is important! After listening to all the evidence, 3 of the jurors in the #ZimmermanTrial originally felt George Zimmerman was guilty. Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Defense Attorney Mark O'Mara said prosecutors "denigrate" the jury's decision. "How dare they" question jury's verdict. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37 doesn't seems to be confused about key elements of the case she just spent 3 weeks following. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Didn't find Rachel Jeantel credible as a witness but did believe her "creepy ass cracker" statement. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: Rachel Jeantel wasn't a good witness, used phrases I had never heard before. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: I didn't think Rachel Jeantel's testimony was very credible. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    Juror B37: "I think it was George Zimmerman's" voice on the 911 call. All but probably 1 of jurors agreed. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013
keithboykin	r	    I think Juror B37 says Dr. Vincent Di Maio was most credible, "awe-inspiring." She can't remember his name. #ZimmermanTrial Jul 16, 2013

ron_christie	r	    @velvetnikitaB We asked China to hold #Snowden - they let him go to Russia. We asked Russia to extradite him + they let him go. Go O. #tcot Aug 01, 2013
ron_christie	r	    So POTUS + AG ask Russia to turn #Snowden over to US and Putin responds by granting him asylum. Real leadership in action. #tcot #lnyhbt Aug 01, 2013

ron_christie	r	    @LiberalVHoovers I notice that you're eager to call people "right wing." Is this code for racist? This makes left sound intolerant. #tcot Jul 22, 2013

ron_christie	r	    Prosecutors as well as #TrayvonMartin parents have said race had nothing to do w/altercation yet POTUS does. Will enflame tensions. #tcot Jul 19, 2013
